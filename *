						<h2>Upwards crowdsources and clusters data to elicit more effective policymaking and development efforts </h2>

						<p>	
						Upwards brings together data from around the world on past and ongoing developmental efforts of all types and scopes. Upwards then performs state of the art machine learning algorithms to uncover latent structures and similarities between these efforts. With this knowledge base of past experience and insight, local leaders, policymakers, and changemakers can be much more successful in solving the developental problems at hand. </p>

							<p style = "text-align: center"> In a village in Northern Tanzania, a small internationally based NGO leads the development of a community-based irrigation solution by working with farmers that will allow ample and equitable water distribution. Meanwhile in the Sarawak district of Malaysia, a bureaucratic officer looks for ways to reform the tax department so that citizens might regain faith in the tax officers and pay taxes voluntarily. In India, a cabinet minister of the state of Gujarat is trying to figure out economic policies that will attract foreign capital investment while creating safeguards against extractive corporations and capital volatility. </p>

							All the nations of the world, thousands of provincial districts, tens of thousands of small towns, have collectively tried out hundreds of thousands of policies and implementation efforts for achieving various socioeconomic development goals. These efforts, originating both from within and outside the government, range from infrastructure development to the education of women, with each one leading to unique results. </p>

		 					It’s time to bring this data together, so that change-makers spread across the world can learn from each other and have access to real data on what works and what doesn’t.  By bringing together the insights and wisdom of developmental efforts into one platform and uncovering latent similarities in this data through statistical analysis, we can help leaders and change-makers make better decisions that are more likely to engender positive change.
